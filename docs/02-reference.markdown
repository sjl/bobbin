## Package `BOBBIN`

### `WRAP` (function)

    (WRAP STRING-OR-STRINGS WIDTH)

Wrap `string-or-strings` to `width`.

  `string-or-strings` can be a string or a list of strings.  A list of strings
  is treated as multiple lines.  In either case the string(s) may also contain
  newlines.  All of these linebreaks will be included in the output â€” wrapping
  will only add linebreaks, never remove them.

  The result with be of the same type as the argument: either a single string
  (containing newlines) or a list of strings (not containing newlines).

  Examples:

    (print (wrap (format nil "foo bar baz") 3))
    foo
    bar
    baz

    (print (wrap (format nil "foo bar baz") 7))
    foo bar
    baz

    (print (wrap (format nil "foo~%bar baz") 7))
    foo
    bar baz

    (print (wrap '("foo" "bar baz") 7))
    ("foo" "bar baz")

    (print (wrap '("foo" "bar baz") 3))
    ("foo" "bar" "baz")
